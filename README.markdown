SpaceWar!
---------

Spacewar! is one of the earliest known digital computer games. It is a two-player game, with each player taking control of a spaceship and attempting to destroy the other.

A star in the centre of the screen pulls on both ships and requires maneuvering to avoid falling into it.

This is an implementation using pygame and python.
